This tool is used to analyze the error log generated by executing monkey test. Monkey test command should point error log such as “2>Error.log”, so example command should be:
“adb shell monkey --pct-syskeys 0 --throttle 100 --pkg-whitelist-file /data/whitelist_android.txt --ignore-crashes --ignore-timeouts --ignore-security-exceptions --ignore-native-crashes --monitor-native-crashes -v -v -v 10000000 1>Monkey.log 2>Error.log”

Mainly through regular filtering log about three types of exceptions, and they are classified into Excel files.

ANR (application not responding): that is, the application does not respond, the program will pop up a dialog to prompt the user that the program does not respond, which is undoubtedly very bad for the user experience.

Crash: that is, crash. Like anr, the system will pop up a dialog to prompt the user that the application has crashed. Similarly, the user experience is terrible. The reason why crash occurs, in a word, is basically because of the occurrence of exceptions

Exception: This function will be improved later and continue to be classified

Output:
.xlsl
Type	Package	Content
ANR/Crash/Exception	Package name Exception occurred at. 	Will intercept all relevant log contents.
